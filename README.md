# Pewlet Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis

## Overview
Pewlet Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees. Because so many employees are nearing retirement age, the company is concerned about a silver tsunami ahead, and wants to be sure new employees are trained well-trained and mentored before the more experienced staff heads out the door.  The HR analyist on staff needs to answer questions about who will be retireing in the next few years and how many positions might need to be filled, and I will be helping him build a hearty relational database from mulitple excell files that all the company has used to store employee data up to now.

### Step 1: Reviewing the data
There are six main cvs files that store employee data.  Bobby (the Pewlet Hackard HR analyst) and I worked together to generate this ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to have a visual of the conceptual, logical, and physical content of each table that will be added to our final database. The image below clearly shows primary and foreign keys in each table and the way each table relates/connects to another.

### Step 2: Preparing the new database
The decision was made to use the PostgreSQL environment for the new database and the accompanying PGadmin software to build, access and easily query the data. Once the database was initialized, the empty structure for each of the 6 tables in our ERD was created and the csv content of all 6 was loaded into the new environment. Once each table's content was confirmed without errors, we could begin writing queries to pull specific data and create new tables that contained retirement-specific data -- and easily answer all of our retirement questions.

The two biggest questions being:
- What is the nmber of retirement eligible employees and what are the jobs they will leave empty?
- Who are the employees that would be the best eligible candidates for any mentorship program?

### Step 3: Writing the queries

Initially, we searched for employees of retirement age using the birth date information in the main 'employee' table. We had settled on employees born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955 -- and were terrified to realize that was over 90K employees.  Because of this we searched by each year individually, but all were fairly consistent with between 21K and ~23K employees/year - so we tried to limit the number by including a length of service range as well and created our first attempt at a retirement list with the query:

    SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
    INTO retirement_info
    FROM employees
    WHERE (birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
    AND (hire_date BETWEEN '1985-01-01' AND '1988-12-31');

From there we looked at departments, titles, and salaries individually, and created a few summary tables combining different characteristics like retirement eligible and salary info or retirment eligible and department, etc. Eventually realizing that the data contained people who no longer worked at Pewlet Hackard AND that many employees had multiple listings due to promotions and job title changes.

Eventually we got our main retirement query to return accurate counts and quality information.
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (e.emp_no) e.emp_no,
      e.first_name,
      e.last_name,
      j.title,
      j.from_date,
      j.to_date
      INTO retirement_count
    FROM employees as e
    INNER JOIN titles as j
    ON (e.emp_no = j.emp_no)
    WHERE (e.birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
    AND (to_date = '9999-01-01')
    ORDER BY e.emp_no, j.from_date DESC;
  
The query above returns 72458 results, which is equal to the number in a query without DISTINCT ON, or designating a from_date ORDER BY, but Bobby and I thought of situations where someone might be holding an interim position and perhaps entered twice, so we agreed this query would knock any issue like that out as well.  We were pleasantly surprised when the numbers matched. 72458 employees are retirement age and currently still employed.

## Summary

How many roles will need to be filled as the 'silver tsunami' begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
